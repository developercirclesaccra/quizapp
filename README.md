# QuizApp
Test a user's understanding of basic prgramming topics.

## Background
I just discovered Github projects and it seems fantastic especially in the way it turns issues in a repo to cards on the project board. It provides both project and code management in one place and some activities like managing tasks with cards can be automated via commits and pull requests.

So, to learn more about how it works, I decided to use it to build something I've been looking for to help a few persons I've been mentoring remotely. A QuizApp that will cummulatively test users on basic programming topics like Linux commands, Git, etc.

I'll be using this to learn and would also for it to be a learning opportunity for you too. So feel free to contribute. There are issues for every category of developer labeled accordingly.

## To contribute
Head over to the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/developercirclesaccra/projects/3) and look at the cards in **To do** column. If you find something you'd like to work on, follow the steps below to contribute to the project:

* Open the issue and assign it to yourself taking note of the issue number (#1, #2, #3, etc)
* Fork the repo associated with the issue
* Clone your fork of the repo to you local machine
* Make your changes, stage, commit and push them to your fork. You will notice that the default branch is **dev** branch, stay on it.
* Create a PR from your fork to the project repo and remember to 
    * include the issue your PR fixes by using [one of these terms](https://blog.github.com/2013-05-14-closing-issues-via-pull-requests/) for example "resolves #2", "fixed #6", etc, in the body of your PR
    * associate the PR with the project by selecting the project from the **Projects** section on the right hand side bar

As soon as your PR is sent, the card will automatically move to **In progress** column. When the PR is merged, the card will move to **Done** column and the issue will be automatically closed.

## Note
If you have any challenges including access to DevC Accra Github organization, mention John Otu or Oliver Mensah in a [Developer Circles Facebook group](https://web.facebook.com/groups/DevCAccra) post and we will help.
